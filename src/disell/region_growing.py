"""
In this script we implement different region growing alghorithmens, which are used to grow initial cell seeds, into cells covering the complete mask.

The different alghoritms are:
- region_grow_minimum_cell_orientation_differences:  this also inclusdes a mnumby implemenation of a priority queue
- a water shed based alghorithmen on the locla cell orientation differences


Numba based priority queue implementation is based on:
-Min-heap priority queue: only the parent ≤ children heap property is maintained,so the array is not globally sorted, but the smallest cost is always at index 0.
 Pushing and popping both run in O(log n), like Python's built-in heapq.
